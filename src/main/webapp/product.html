					<span class="Book Description"> <br>
						<b>-->Sinopsis</b> <p>Problem: things fall apart. Solution: think your way out of it. It may sound easy, but often the simplest things are the hardest, 
						right? CPA Kara Lane, the author of The Thinking Game, is aware of this and has expertly broken down how to change thought patterns in real-time. 
						By shifting your thinking, she argues that manifesting the things you want is more attainable. By playing Lane’s ‘game of thought,’ 
						you’ll be able to nail goal crushing, refine your discernment skills, focus on delight instead of dread, and prioritize the things that you have 
						agency over instead of wasting time on things you don’t. If thoughts really do become things, then we’d suggest thinking about reading this self-help book. </p>
